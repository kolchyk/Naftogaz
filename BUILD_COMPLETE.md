## 📱 Next Steps

### 1. Test on Device
```bash
# For debug build
npm run android

# Or manually:
./gradlew installMlkitDebugOptimized
```

### 2. Generate Release Keys (For Production)
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias release -storepass password -keypass password
```

### 3. Sign Release APK
```bash
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA \
  -digestalg SHA1 -keystore release.keystore \
  app-mlkit-release.apk release
```

### 4. Upload to Google Play Store
- Go to Google Play Console
- Create new app
- Upload signed APK
- Fill metadata
- Submit for review

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Default Keystore**: Uses Android debug keystore
   - Suitable for development and testing
   - Replace with production key before Play Store release

2. **APK Size**: 128-131 MB (including all native libraries)
   - Includes ML Kit models
   - All ABI architectures
   - Can be reduced using App Bundle for Play Store

3. **Kotlin Version Mismatch**: Expected with React Native 0.82
   - Does not affect app functionality
   - Resolved in newer React Native versions

4. **Debuggable**: Debug builds are debuggable
   - Release builds have debugging disabled

## 🔐 Security Checklist

Before releasing to production:
- [ ] Generate production keystore
- [ ] Sign APK with production key
- [ ] Enable ProGuard/R8 minification
- [ ] Test on real devices
- [ ] Review permissions (CameraManifest)
- [ ] Check crash reporting setup
- [ ] Configure analytics
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Verify ML Kit model updates

---

## 🎓 Troubleshooting

### APK Too Large?
```bash
# Use App Bundle instead (for Play Store)
./gradlew bundleReleaseMlkit
# This splits APK by device configuration
```

### App Crashes?
```bash
# Check logs
adb logcat -s "*" | grep FATAL

# Or use Android Studio logcat
```

### Performance Issues?
```bash
# Profile the app
./gradlew profileMlkitRelease

# Or use Android Profiler in Android Studio
```
